# PsychAI: A Mental Illness Chatbot Revolutionizing Mental Health Care üßò
## An in Depth Analysis of Why We Created This Project üß†

Mental illness is a growing concern that affects millions of people worldwide. Despite the prevalence of mental health issues, many individuals still find it challenging to seek help due to the stigma surrounding mental health. The good news is that advancements in technology are changing the way we approach mental health care. One such innovative solution is PsychAI, a mental illness chatbot that provides instant support and resources to individuals struggling with mental health issues.

## Inspiration üí°
We were inspired to created PsychAI by the growing need for accessible mental health care. With the rise of mental illness, there has been a significant increase in demand for mental health services. However, the supply of mental health professionals has not kept up with this demand, making it difficult for individuals to access the care they need. PsychAI was developed to bridge this gap and provide support to those who need it most.
